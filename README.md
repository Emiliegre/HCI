Hand-in 3 (Deadline October 13th)

Implement a basic todo list in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It should be possible to: 

    Add new todos (as text)
    Mark todos as completed
    Delete todos
    Edit the text on a todo
    Store the data in local storage

You should

    not use any external JavaScript or CSS libraries or frameworks
    create a nicely styled todo list interface using CSS
    implement it offline using Visual Studio code as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files 
    not just find a solution online 
    upload the assignment as a zip-file including your HTML, JS, CSS and a report as PDF

Write a short report that includes:

    A description of how your todo list works
    How you have applied what you've learned about visual perception and gestalt principles (max 0.25 pages)
    What interaction style(s) are you using? (max 0.25 pages)
    How you adhere to (relevant) design principles (max 0.5 pages)
        You can choose to emphasize three

An excellent solution to the assignment:

     Implements all the features describe above
     Has an interface that is thought through visually and doesn't violate gestalt principles
     Has code that is nice and clean with proper indentation etc. (see, e.g., this page for inspiration)
     A well-written and well-structured report. Care has been made to avoid typos and grammar mistakes.
